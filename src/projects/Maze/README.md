# Maze project

# Phase 1. Maze modeling

You "inherited" this model of a grid from an engineer who has moved on. 
For phase 1, you need to finish the testing and documentation of the grid model. 
There is also a bug in the implementation that needs to be found and fixed.

Once the grid model is tested and documented, you will use it to implement a model of a maze. 

## Checklists

### 1.1 Debug, test, and document the starter code
- [ ] Get the files from the class repo into your fork.
    - [ ] from `src/projects/maze`
    - [ ] `test/projects/maze`
- [ ] Fix the bug making the current tests fail.
- [ ] Add more unit tests to ensure complete coverage.
- [ ] Add javadocs to the important methods. Add comments in code if you like.

### 1.2 Extend the starter code to be useful for the maze project
Design notes are in the headers of Maze.java and MazeCell.java. 
You can also read the Main routine and see what methods are required, 
and work backwards from there.

- [ ] Implement maze class. **Test coverage is mandatory!**
- [ ] Add new features to cell class. **Test coverage is mandatory!**
- [ ] Run the main routine and confirm that the I/O routines work with your Maze 
implementation. 

Your output text file should be this:
